Game Concept:
1. Panda Runner Battle-Game
    A cross between like mario and battle boss.
    a. Before starting pick a class and name.
    b. Go through levels running through collecting coins and avoiding small obstacles. (super mario like style)
    c. With coins you can upgrade your items/stats once you reach the end.
    d. Each class has different abilities and base stats. 
    e. After each level the monsters scale as well. 
    f. Choose EASY or HARD mode 
        EASY: keeps items even if you fail level, continue to collect coins to upgrade and beat boss.
        HARD: loose all gold if you hit an obstacle and must restart from the amount you had at the beginning of the level.
